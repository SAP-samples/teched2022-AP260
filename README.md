# AP260 - Beyond Just an NFT: Unlocking Utility in Smart Contracts

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called AP260 - Beyond Just an NFT: Unlocking Utility in Smart Contracts.  

## Overview

This workshop introduces attendees to the basics of modern smart contract development for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based smart contracts. The workshop is split into three exercises that build upon each other:

- **Part 1** introduces the participants to a basic sample project using the Hardhat development environment. Here, we will make sure that your system is correctly setup and leave you with a basic understanding how smart contracts are created, tested and deployed to a local test network. 
- In **Part 2** we dive into the world of specialized smart contracts, here ERC-721 contracts which are used for NFTs. You will create your first fully functional NFT smart contract, deploy it to a live test network and interact with it via tools such as MetaMask from a browser. 
- Finally, **Part 3** will teach you how smart contracts can be modified to add features and functionality beyond the standard features. While we will discuss SAP Customer Experience related functionalities in our presentation, you will work hands-on on a smart contract that can be used for event ticketing.  

## Requirements
Let's first run through some requirements, which need to be installed in your local development environment. 
- Make sure [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is installed. 
- We'll be using hardhat, a nodejs-based Ethereum development environment. That's why you need to check if you have Node.js (preferably the 16.17.1 LTS) installed. Try this out via Visual Studio Code: open a new Terminal and type `node --version` which hopefully prints the recommended version.

Note to non-workshop, self-paced / study at home participants: you will notice that you will require API keys (Etherscan, Alchemy) and a (funded) Ethereum test account at some point. **For the workshop, we provide all these items so the participants do not waste time creating these accounts nor do they need to use their own private accounts.** If you follow along outside of a workshop, plan for some extra time to create accounts and request API keys for these services:

- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) - well-known web3 development platform which gives us access to live testnet nodes
- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer which we use to interact and verify our smart contracts
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), a well-known crypto wallet which is installed as a plugin to web browsers such as Chrome or Edge. You will need to export the private key for the hardhat config of one of the accounts. If you need to fund your account with Goerli test Ether, we recommend to use [goerlifaucet.com](https://goerlifaucet.com/) which requires an Alchemy account. 

All good? Congrats. Let's dive right in.
